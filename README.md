# Recursion Checkpoint
# Palindrome Checker Algorithm:
This primary algorithm engages with the user by soliciting input for a word. It subsequently invokes the 'palindrome' function to assess whether the input word qualifies as a palindrome.

# Palindrome Function:
The 'palindrome' function is a recursive function designed to evaluate whether a given word exhibits palindrome characteristics. It takes a single argument, 'word,' which is the string under examination.

The function adheres to the following logic:

1. If the length of the 'word' is less than 2 characters, indicating it's either a single character or an empty space, the function immediately concludes by returning 'word is a palindrome' as the base case. A single character or an empty space is considered a palindrome.

2. If the first character of the 'word' differs from the last character, the function concludes that 'word is not a palindrome.' This is because a mismatch between the first and last characters signifies a lack of palindromic properties.

3. If neither of the preceding cases applies, the function triggers a recursive call to itself after eliminating the first and last characters from the 'word.' It continues this recursive process with the trimmed 'word' until one of the base cases is reached.

# The function then provides the result.

Variable Declarations:
- 'tag' and 'trimmed' are initialized as empty strings.
- 'i' functions as an integer counter.
- 'n' is assigned the length of the input 'word.'

# Base Case:
1. If the length of the input 'word' is less than 2 or if 'word' is an empty space (i.e., a single character or an empty string), the function promptly returns 'word is a palindrome.' This constitutes the base case, terminating the recursion.

Else If:
2. If the initial and final characters of the input 'word' (at indices 0 and 'n - 1') do not match, the function determines that the 'word is not a palindrome' and returns this verdict.

Else (Recursive Case):
3. If neither of the base cases applies, the function proceeds to execute the recursive logic within loop block A. A FOR loop is utilized to construct a new string, 'trimmed,' derived from the original 'word' with its initial and final characters removed.

The 'palindrome' function is then recursively invoked using the 'trimmed' 'word,' and the outcome is stored in the 'tag' variable.

Return Tag:
The function returns the value of 'tag,' which will be either 'word is a palindrome' or 'word is not a palindrome' depending on the input.

# In Summary:
The 'palindrome_checker' algorithm receives user input for a word and leverages the 'palindrome' function to assess its palindromic nature. The 'palindrome' function employs recursion and base cases to make this determination, and the final result is conveyed to the user."
